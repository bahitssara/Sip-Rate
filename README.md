## Motivation 
I was inspired to create an app that allows wine lovers to search their favorite or least favorite wines, and store their thoughts about that wine all in one place. As a wine lover myself I've found it's easy to have a wine and not remember at all how I felt about it. Then was born Sip & Rate!

## Summary

This app is focused for personal use and aimed at frequent users who return to view all their thoughts! Users can also view all posted reviews, just to see what others may think.
